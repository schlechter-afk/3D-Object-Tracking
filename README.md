# Real-time 3D Object Tracking with Frustum Projection

The current script can be found [here](code/script.py) and the corresponding testing notebook [here](code/testing.ipynb)

The repository does not contain the `.mp4` video sequences captured from multiple views and also the pretrained object detection model.

## Updates:
- **10/12/2024**: Updated code with denser representation for object tracking via space carving and segmentation-aware 3D object detection. The code for the same can be found [here](code/script_sam.py) and the module for the same can be found [here](code/dense_recon.py).
